## Solution Analysis

### Accepted
**Runtime:** 0ms
**Memory:** 11.22MB

The provided solution has been accepted and performs efficiently. It uses two pointers, `currentString1` and `currentString2`, to iterate through `word1` and `word2`, respectively. It also uses `currentChar1` and `currentChar2` to iterate through the characters within each string.

The solution compares characters at the current positions in both arrays and checks if they are equal. If they are not equal, it returns `false`. If the end of a string is reached, it resets the character pointer and advances to the next string.

The loop continues until both arrays are fully traversed. If either array still has remaining strings after the loop, it returns `false`, indicating that the arrays do not represent the same string. Otherwise, it returns `true`, indicating that the arrays are equivalent.

The solution achieves excellent runtime performance, beating 100% of users, and it is memory-efficient, beating 98.12% of users in C++.
