## Solution Analysis

### Runtime: 0 ms (Beats 100%)
### Memory: 6.1 MB (Beats 22.46%)

The provided C++ solution efficiently calculates the number of days between two given dates in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". It uses the `std::get_time`, `std::mktime`, and `std::difftime` functions to convert and calculate the difference in seconds between the two dates. The result is then converted to days by dividing by the number of seconds in a day.

The solution performs exceptionally well in terms of runtime, beating 100% of submissions. However, in terms of memory usage, it beats 22.46% of submissions, which is still reasonable.

Overall, this solution provides an accurate and efficient way to calculate the number of days between two valid dates within the specified range.
