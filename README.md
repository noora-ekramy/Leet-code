## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to LeetCode problems. Each problem is contained within its own folder, which includes the problem statement, my code solution, and explanations or comments as needed. I strive to write clean, well-documented code to showcase my problem-solving skills.

## Problem Categories

I've categorized the problems to help you find specific solutions easily:

- [Array Problems](/array)
- [String Problems](/string)
- [LinkedList Problems](/linkedlist)
- [Tree Problems](/tree)
- [Sorting and Searching Problems](/sorting-searching)
- [Dynamic Programming Problems](/dynamic-programming)
- [Graph Problems](/graph)
- [Math Problems](/math)
- [Design Problems](/design)
- [Other Problems](/other)

## Solved Problems

NUM_SOLVED=$(ls -l | grep -c '^d')
echo "Number of solved problems: $NUM_SOLVED"

## Usage

You can navigate through the problem categories above to find the specific LeetCode problems you're interested in. Inside each problem folder, you will find:

- `problem.md`: The problem statement.
- `solution.c`: My C++ solution to the problem.
- `explanation.md`: Detailed explanations, time complexity analysis, and any additional notes.

Feel free to explore the code and explanations to better understand my approach to each problem. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the coding community. If you have improvements to my code, better explanations, or want to add new problem solutions, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
