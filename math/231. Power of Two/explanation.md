The provided C++ solution determines whether an integer `n` is a power of two by checking if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. This is achieved by using the bitwise AND operation with `n` and `(n - 1)`. If the result is zero, it means there is only one bit set to 1, indicating that `n` is a power of two.

The solution performs exceptionally well in terms of runtime, beating 100% of submissions. In terms of memory usage, it beats 50.68% of submissions, which is still reasonable.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient and bitwise approach to determine whether an integer is a power of two without the need for loops or recursion.
